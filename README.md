# TransitForge

TransitForge — browser-based 3D public transportation planning and simulation sandbox.

## Stack

- TypeScript + React + Vite
- Three.js (no game engine)
- HTML/CSS, Web Workers when needed for simulation performance

## Architecture

Three separated layers:

1. `src/simulation/` — pure TypeScript. City data, zones, graph, routes, demand,
   routing (Dijkstra/A*), ticks, loads, statistics. No React / Three.js imports.
2. `src/rendering/` — Three.js only. Consumes simulation state, no sim logic.
3. `src/ui/` — React dashboard, controls, inspectors. No sim logic inside components
   beyond calling the simulation API.

Supporting folders: `src/types/`, `src/data/`, `src/workers/`.

## Run

```sh
npm install
npm run dev
```

Build:

```sh
npm run build
```

## Status

- v0.1 scaffold: Vite + React + Three wired, deterministic `createSimulation(seed)`,
  isolated layers, orbit/pan/zoom viewport.
- Next: seeded coastal megacity, transport graph, O/D demand, routing, dashboard.

## Principle

A metro line must exist in the simulation model. Stations have demand. Routes affect
travel times. Network edits must be capable of changing simulation results.
